# FDS-project
Group project for the course Fundamentals of Data Science
Group members: Yelizaveta, Suleyman, Daniele and Sigurd


In this project we will utilize several different techniques for classification. The goal is to write a code able to predict wether or not an individual with some given features would be likely to purchase travel insurance. The training set is based taken from Kaggle, and is included in this repository.

The techniques we will use are: Logistic regression, Naive Bayes and Random tree. The performance of these techniques will be compared and discussed.

The dataset includes 10 possible features for consideration.
